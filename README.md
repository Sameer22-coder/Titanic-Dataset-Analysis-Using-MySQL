# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis-Using-MySQL
This project showcases SQL-based data analysis on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights from historical passenger data. It covers basic to advanced SQL queries including filtering, aggregation, sorting, subqueries, and conditional logic. The goal is to demonstrate SQL proficiency through real-world data exploration.

# Key Insights
1)Most passengers boarded from Southampton (S).

2)Average passenger fare was ~$32; some paid over $500.

3)Average age was around 29.7 years; 177 records had missing age values.

4)A large number of passengers paid very low or zero fare.

5)Many analytical queries helped reveal demographic and survival patterns.

# SQL Highlights
1.Basic queries (e.g., first 10 passengers)

2.Aggregations by class and embarkation port

3.Fare-based classifications using CASE

4.Subqueries for average-based comparisons

5.Pattern matching to extract titles like "Mr." and "Mrs."

6.Filtering by age, class, and survival status
